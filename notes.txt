Q. What is WebRTC?
-> WebRRTC is a set of JavaScript API's that allows us to establish peer to peer connection between two browsers to exchange data such as audio and video in real time.
-> Real Time Communication
-> Lower Latency
-> It's different from WebSockets as WebSockets achieve real time communication through a server (peer to server) and WebRTC uses the browser, data never touches the server.
-> WebRTC transports it's data over UDP (UDP is fast).
    -> UDP is not reliable protocol for transferring important data. It sends data fast but never checks if data has reached or not.
    -> There is no built in signaling in WebRTC, so we have to make the initial connection on our own and then WebRTC will takeover.

Q. What is being sent beetween the two clients and how is it sent?
-> Both the peers need to exchange a Session Description Protocol (SDP), one in the form of an offer and one in the form of an answer
-> SDP is an object containing some description about both peers.
-> In addition to the SDP, both clients will share a seriese of ICE candidates.
-> An ICE candidate is a public IP address and port that could potentially be an address that recieves data.

Q. Elaborate on exchanging SDP and ICE candidate.
-> First obe browser will send it's SDP to a server and the server will send that to the other browser and will recieve a response contaaining it's SDP.
-> Now the connection between both the peers has been established but the the data can't flow between the clients.
-> As most devices sit behind firewalls and NAT devices, we need to coordinnate the discovery of our public IP addresses for the data to start  flowing.
-> We do this using a method called ICE. 
-> One client will ask the STUN server about it's public IP address and it will send it to the otheer client using a seriese of ICE candidates. The other client will recieve these ICE candidates and it will do the same.
-> Once the network finds the optimal path to communicate through, data will start flowing and the entire connection is complete.
